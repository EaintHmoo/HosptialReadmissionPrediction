# HosptialReadmissionPrediction


### Abstract
A hospital readmission is when a patient who is discharged from the hospital, gets re-admitted again within a certain period of time.
Hospital readmissions increase the healthcare costs and negatively influence hospitals’ reputation.
Being able to predict which patients will get readmitted can help hospitals save millions of dollars by avoiding lawsuits while improving quality of care
This work, an approach that balances between data engineering and learning algorithm for predicting hospital readmission among diabetic patients.


### Objectives
To help the hospitals accurately predict if a patient is going to get readmitted after discharge.

If a patient is going to be readmitted, the hospital will be able to make necessary treatment changes to avoid the patient readmission. 

Understand the utility of learning models using all existing resources—in the hospital and the community— to predict the hospital readmission.

### Dataset Description
The dataset represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals. It includes 50 features representing 101766 diabetes patients and hospital outcomes
